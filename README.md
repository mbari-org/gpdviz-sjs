# Gpdviz

Gpdviz is a generic, lightweight tool for web-based
visualization of geo-located point data streams in real-time.

**Status**: Functional but still considered experimental.

Data providers use the Gpdviz REST API to register sensor systems,
data streams, and observations.
This API is specified using [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md).
The visualization is updated in real-time using WebSockets.

Assuming Gpdviz is deployed at `http://example.net/gpdviz`:

| url | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `http://example.net/gpdviz/mysysid/` | Visualization of sensor system with ID `mysysid`
| `http://example.net/gpdviz/api`      | The REST API endpoint
| `http://example.net/gpdviz/api-docs` | API documentation


**Data model**

The main entities in the data model are:
_sensor systems_, _data streams_, _variable definitions_, and _observations_.

- A _sensor system_ has associated metadata (name, description, etc.)
  and consists of a set of _data streams_.

- A _data stream_ has associated metadata (name, description, map/chart styles, etc.)
  and consists of a set of _variable definitions_ and associated _observations_.

- A _variable definition_ consists of a name, units, and chart style.

- An _observation_ is timestamped and can capture scalar data (e.g., temperature values),
  as well as features and geometries (in GeoJson format).
 
**Operations for data providers**

- Register/unregister sensor systems
- Add/remove data streams
- Add/remove variable definitions
- Register observations

The Gpdviz server maintains a registry with the provided information for each sensor system
including a window of most recent reported observations for each stream in the system.
Users will be able to see the latest reported state whenever they open the particular
URL corresponding to the desired sensor system, and in real time see any subsequent
updates reported by the provider.


## Running

### Direct execution

To execute Gpdviz you will need a [Java runtime environment](https://www.java.com/),
access to a PostgreSQL server, and ability to create a database and a user on that
server for Gpdviz purposes.

Download the latest executable JAR `gpdviz-x.y.z.jar` from https://github.com/gpdviz/gpdviz/releases/.

- Gpdviz expects a number of parameters for its regular execution. These parameters are to be
  indicated in a local `conf/gpdviz.conf` file. A template of such file, with
  a description of the various parameters, can be generated as follows:

        $ java -jar gpdviz-x.y.z.jar generate-conf

- Edit `conf/gpdviz.conf` as needed.

- Create the database and user indicated in `gpdviz.conf`, with the user being granted
  all privileges on the database.

- Execute the Gpdviz server:

        $ java -jar gpdviz-x.y.z.jar run-server


### Docker

With a Docker engine on your target system, you will only need to define some
parameters (via environment variables) and launch the services defined in
[docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yml).
This set-up includes the PostgreSQL server and database.
Please see https://hub.docker.com/r/gpdviz/gpdviz/.

### Demo

This [httpie](https://httpie.io/)-based
[bash script](data/ss1.demo.sh)
can be used as a demo of a data provider. Define the `GPDVIZ_SERVER` environment
variable prior to running this script.

For a similar demo in Python, see https://github.com/gpdviz/gpdviz_python_client_example,
which uses the client module https://github.com/gpdviz/gpdviz_python_client
automatically generated from the OpenAPI specification.

## Development

Gpdviz implementation is based on:

- [Akka-HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/)
- [Slick](https://github.com/slick/slick)
- [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres)
- [ScalaJS](https://www.scala-js.org/)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/)


### Build and run

    $ npm install jsdom source-map-support
	$ sbt
	> package   # to copy js resources to jvm's classpath needed for the webapp
	> gpdvizJVM/runMain gpdviz.Gpdviz generate-conf
	> gpdvizJVM/runMain gpdviz.Gpdviz create-tables
	> gpdvizJVM/runMain gpdviz.Gpdviz add-some-data
	> gpdvizJVM/runMain gpdviz.Gpdviz run-server

For the demo with sensor system ID "ss1":

- Open http://localhost:5050/ss1/ in your browser.
- On another terminal, either run the bash script:

	    $ data/ss1.demo.sh
	
    or the similar client in python as explained at
    https://github.com/gpdviz/gpdviz_python_client_example

### Dist

To generate the executable JAR `jvm/target/scala-2.12/gpdviz-x.y.z.jar`:

	$ sbt gpdvizJVM/assembly

For the dockerized version, see [docker/readme.md](docker/readme.md).

### Model

Data model details are still wip.

### API

OpenAPI spec generated by [swagger-akka-http](https://github.com/swagger-akka-http/swagger-akka-http).

**Swagger UI**

A Swagger UI instance is embedded as follows:

- copy [Swagger UI dist/*](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/master/dist)
  contents to `jvm/src/main/resources/swaggerui/`;
- adjust the `url` entry in `swaggerui/index.html` to refer to the generated spec:
  `url: window.location + "/swagger.json"`
- rebuild

Under local development:
- generated spec at http://localhost:5050/api-docs/swagger.json
- Swagger UI at http://localhost:5050/api-docs
